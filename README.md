# Portfolio-Website

This is the source code for my static website. This site is also responsive. I will deploy this website utilizing Cloud Infursture AWS S3. The site will ultimatly provide recuiters with short videos and pictures of personal projects that I have completed to increase my development in my personal time. In addition, this site will be used to provide my customers with a central cite to not only see some of the work that I have done on my own time but see some of the clients I have worked with to provide them with more insight of the remote application developer that they will be hiring.
