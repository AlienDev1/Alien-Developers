          <p>
          I am currently an undergrad at Kennesaw State University, dual majoring in Software Engineering and Applied Mathematics. My background is in software integration, maintenance, and development. I have worked in several capacities where I assisted with the implementation and integration of various applications ranging from the utilization of App Dynamics and Data Dog to managing data in various Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) like DynamoDB and AWS to name a couple. What I am looking for is a company where I will have the opportunity to produce a positive return on investment. Also working within a collaborative team. I would love to talk more regarding your company culture and common daily practices within the role!
