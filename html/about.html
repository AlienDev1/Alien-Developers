          <p>
            I am currently an undergrad at Kennesaw State University, where I dual major in Software Engineering and Applied Mathmatics. My background is in software integration, security, maintenance, and development. I have worked in several capactities ranging from the role of a Data Science Engineer for computational analysis, Working as a Software Engineer closely with network engineers to defend the US from cyber attackers from overseas, to a Software Engineer developing tools for companies to manage billions of dollars all while implementing common coding practices in compliance with OWASP. I have about 8 years of of Enterprise Development experience. I have worked for various companies such as Chick-Fil-A corperate, Equifax, and I have done some contract work for NASA to name a few. In my experience I could not help but notice the development space is vastly under represented for people of color. In addition, for brick and mortor business to obtain the top skills to assist them in there business ventures there is a major gap in financial ability to get over that hurtle. I am here merely as not just a professional but as a resource to assist with bridge that gap and bringing top talent in a more affordable mannor. My goal is to assist people with accomplishing there dreams by way of technology by allowing and allowing there imagination to come to life.

            <p>When things go wrong, as they sometimes will,<br>When the road you’re trudging seems all uphill,<br>When the funds are low and the debts are high,<br>And you want to smile,but you have to sigh,<br>When care is pressing you down a bit,<br>Rest, if you must, but don’t you quit.</p>
            <p>Life is queer with its twists and turns,<br>As every one of us sometimes learns,<br>And many a failure turns about,<br>When he might have won had he stuck it out;<br>Don’t give up though the pace seems slow you may succeed with another blow.</p>
            <p>Often the goal is nearer than, it seems to a faint and faltering man,<br>Often the struggler has given up,<br>When he might have captured the victor’s cup,<br>And he learned too late when the night slipped down,<br>How close he was to the golden crown.</p>
            <p>Success is failure turned inside out,<br>the silver tint of the clouds of doubt,<br>And you never can tell how close you are, <br>it may be near when it seems so far,<br>So stick to the fight when you’re hardest hit-It’s when things seem worst that you must not quit</p>
