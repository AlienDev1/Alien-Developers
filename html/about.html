          <p>
          I am currently an undergrad at Kennesaw State University, dual majoring in Software Engineering and Applied Mathematics. My background is in software integration, maintenance, and development. I have worked in several capacities where I assisted with the implementation and integration of various applications ranging from the utilization of App Dynamics and Data Dog to managing data in various Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS) like DynamoDB and AWS to name a couple. What I am looking for is a company where I will have the opportunity to produce a positive return on investment. Also working within a collaborative team. I would love to talk more regarding your company culture and common daily practices within the role!

            <h3>What keeps this guy going?</h3>
            <p>When things go wrong, as they sometimes will,<br>When the road you’re trudging seems all uphill,<br>When the funds are low and the debts are high,<br>And you want to smile,but you have to sigh,<br>When care is pressing you down a bit,<br>Rest, if you must, but don’t you quit.</p>
            <p>Life is queer with its twists and turns,<br>As every one of us sometimes learns,<br>And many a failure turns about,<br>When he might have won had he stuck it out;<br>Don’t give up though the pace seems slow you may succeed with another blow.</p>
            <p>Often the goal is nearer than, it seems to a faint and faltering man,<br>Often the struggler has given up,<br>When he might have captured the victor’s cup,<br>And he learned too late when the night slipped down,<br>How close he was to the golden crown.</p>
            <p>Success is failure turned inside out,<br>the silver tint of the clouds of doubt,<br>And you never can tell how close you are, <br>it may be near when it seems so far,<br>So stick to the fight when you’re hardest hit-It’s when things seem worst that you must not quit</p>
