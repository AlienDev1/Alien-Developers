          <p>
            I am currently an undergrad at Kennesaw State University, where I major in Software Engineering. My background is in software integration, maintenance, and development. I have worked in several capacities where I assisted with the implementation and integration of various applications ranging from the role of a Data Science Engineer utilizing R for computational analysis to a Software Engineer implementing common coding practices in compliance with OWASP. In addition, I have a strong foundation of network principles and protocols such as end-to-end encryption and reliability, Load balance, and WAF(Web application firewall) configuration. I am currently looking for the opportunity to assist people with technology by allowing their imagination to come to life.

          <h1>How did this young man come to have so much experience?</h1>
          <p>
            Fredrick Douglas once said, "If there is no struggle there is no success!". I am identified as a self-starter, Insist on high standards for myself, and a student of life. I particularly say a student of life because I believe we can learn something new from anyone or anything; all we have to do is be still and listen. When I first started applying for entry-level positions I quickly learned about the paradox "we cannot hire you for this Jr. role due to a lack of experience". I refused to bound myself by the odds that were stacked against me I decided to make my own experience. I started implementing and expanding on the foundation that I received from my classes with small projects. In addition, I volunteered my services to my community family, and friends by doing pro bono work within the Atlanta area. Some of the requests that I received were outside of my comfort zone. Yet, I did not quit. I had many sleepless nights working tirelessly with one goal "Provide professional, efficient, and user-friendly work as if this is a million-dollar project". That mindset has expanded my foundation in development beyond words. I have even worked as OOP (Object Oriented Programming) tutor! God and my work ethic have landed me in opportunities that I could not have imagined ranging from working with N.S.B.E Aerospace S.I.G to working in exclusive environments such as Equifax within a NOC (Network Operations Center). I actively continue to build upon my foundation developing, deploying, and testing in my home lab to master my craft.

            <h3>What keeps this guy going?</h3>
            <p>When things go wrong, as they sometimes will,<br>When the road you’re trudging seems all uphill,<br>When the funds are low and the debts are high,<br>And you want to smile,but you have to sigh,<br>When care is pressing you down a bit,<br>Rest, if you must, but don’t you quit.</p>
            <p>Life is queer with its twists and turns,<br>As every one of us sometimes learns,<br>And many a failure turns about,<br>When he might have won had he stuck it out;<br>Don’t give up though the pace seems slow you may succeed with another blow.</p>
            <p>Often the goal is nearer than, it seems to a faint and faltering man,<br>Often the struggler has given up,<br>When he might have captured the victor’s cup,<br>And he learned too late when the night slipped down,<br>How close he was to the golden crown.</p>
            <p>Success is failure turned inside out,<br>the silver tint of the clouds of doubt,<br>And you never can tell how close you are, <br>it may be near when it seems so far,<br>So stick to the fight when you’re hardest hit-It’s when things seem worst that you must not quit</p>
